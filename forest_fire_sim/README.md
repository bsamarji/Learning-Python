# Python_Coursework
 
## Where to start:
- The report is named BIOLM0032_Report_1718673. It is 4 pages long and explains in detail the forest fire model and the analysis of the steady-state. 
- In the scripts folder you will find 6 python scripts. They were made in JuptyerLab so will probably run best in JuptyerLab. 
- The 6 scripts are all fairly similar but do slightly different things. 
- forest_fire_sim1.py and forest_fire_sim2.py have the code which creates the simulation of the forest-fire and the specific rules. They also plot the steady-state graphs. 
- forest_fire_anim1.py and forest_fire_anim2.py create an animation of the simulation.
- forest_fire_analysis1.py and forest_fire_analysis2.py contain the code which analyse the tree growth probability and lightning strike probability. 
- the scripts that end with a 1 are the orignial model and the scripts that end in 2 are the updated model. 
- To run the scripts, just run them how you normally would in JuptyerLab (e.g. python .\forest_fire_analysis2.py).
