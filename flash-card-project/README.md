Flash Card Project
Developed using Python v3.9

In this project I created a flash card app to learn French words. 
The app helps you learn 100 of the most commonly used French words.
The app was primarily designed using the tkinter and pandas modules.
This app could be easily modified to accomadate more words or a different language.
If you want more French words, then just add more words into the french_words.csv.
If you want to change it to a different language then you'll have to make the adjustments to the script yourself ;).

How to use the app:
- When you start the app, a prompt will appear with a flash card displaying a French word.
- You have 3 seconds to determine if you know the word or not. 
- After 3 seconds the flashcard will flip to the reveal the English translation of the French word.
- If you did not know the English translation then click the red button with the cross.
- If you did know the English translation then click the green button with the tick.
- The flashcard will flip again to reveal a new French word.
- If you click the green button, the app will remove this word from the list of words to display in the flashcards, so only words you are yet to learn are displayed on new flashcards.
