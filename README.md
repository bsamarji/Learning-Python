# Learning-Python
Repo for projects that I've built using python, to help me learn the python language.
I've created this repo so I can tack my progress, but hopefully it gives other budding programmers some inspiration.
If you're feeling like you need a new coding challenge, then run one of the apps and see if you can replicate the final product and compare the code once you're done.
